\begin_layout Title
Comparison of the Metropolis and Wang Landau algorithms for the Ising model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ising model is a system in statistical physics that can be used to investiga
te phase transitions using computational algorithms.
 A simple instance of the Ising model might be a two dimensional lattice
 of atoms, each of which can be in one of only two possible states, commonly
 labeled spin up and spin down and taken as the magnetization.
 There is an interaction energy between every atom and each of its four
 nearest neighbors that is equal to -J where the two neighboring spins are
 aligned, or +J where they are opposite.
 Allowing the lattice to equlibriate at a certain temperature will result
 in certain average values of magnetization and energy per atom.
 Ising models in two or more dimensions undergo a phase transition at a
 certain critical temperature, below which the spins of the lattice are
 generally all aligned and above which they are generally at random.
 The physics of this phase transition are applicable to a wide range of
 phenomena and therefore of much interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the Ising model was analytically solved in two dimensions by Lars
 Onsanger in 1944, it is still commonly investigated using computational
 algorithms.
 The first technique commonly applied was the Metropolis algorithm

\end_inset

, which directly simulates fluctuations in the lattice using a Monte Carlo
 process, whereby in successive steps atoms in the lattice are selected
 at random and their spins may be flipped, according to certain rules.
 After a sufficient number of iterations, the lattice will have reached
 equilibrium and its magnetization and energy can be calculated.
 The rules to determine whether or not a candidate spin is flipped at each
 step are as follows: allow all flips that lower the energy of the lattice
 but selectively accept flips that increase the energy of the lattice at
 random, with a probability in each case proportional to the Boltzmann factor
 for the relevant increase in energy and the given temperature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By operating the algorithm with suitable averaging over a range of temperatures,
 the physical characteristics of the Ising model can be measured.
 In addition, the Metropolis algorithm allows the lattice and its fluctuations
 to be visualized (either as snapshots at certain temperatures or as a continuin
g animation), providing some opportunity for intuitive insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Metropolis algorithm is a very elegant and broadly used computational
 technique, but an alternative approach offering higher computational efficiency
 was proposed by Wang and Landau in 2001

.
 The Wang Landau algorithm is also based on a Monte Carol process, but this
 time the fluctuations of the Ising model are not simulated directly.
 Rather, a random walk technique is used to count how many alternative configura
tions of the lattice are available at each possible energy level, i.e.
 the density of states as a function of energy.
 Once the density of states has been determined, a numerical integration
 is performed over all the possible energy levels to calculate the averages
 of magnetization and energy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The random walk process is conducted so that the probability of moving to
 a new state with a given energy, E, at each iteration of the Monte Carlo
 process is

inversely proportional
\shape default
 to the density of states, g(E), at that energy.
 The density of states is not initially known and the starting arrangement
 is g(E) = 1 for all energies.
 Each time a certain energy is visited, g(E) is multiplied by a certain
 factor, f > 1.
 The random walk is finished when the accumulated count of visits to energy
 levels appears as a flat histogram, thus indicating that the random walk
 with p = 1/g(E) verifies the correspondence of g(E) to the actual density
 of states.
 Once a flat histogram is obtained, the exercise is repeated with a smaller
 value of f to improve the precision of g(E).
 In the second step, the numerical integration over all energies, the density
 of states is multiplied by the Boltzmann factor at the given energy and
 temperature to give the probability that the system could be found at that
 particular energy after normalization.
 By repeating the integration for a range of temperatures the physical character
istics of the Ising model can be measured.

Since the original algorithm was originally published various studies have
 looked at its effectiveness and at potential improvements.

gave a proof of the convergence of the Wang Landau algorithm and suggested
 an example optimization strategy whereby the modification factor, f, is
 started at around Exp(4) and reduced by dividing by a large factor ~10
 at each stage.

investigated how the density of states could be established by conducting
 multiple random walks over adjacent restricted energy ranges without incurring
 boundary effects.

derived an expression for the residual error of the Wang Landau algorithm
 and as a result identified the central role of the histogram accumulated
 during the density of states calculation in the overall accuracy of the
 method.
 They observed that after a certain number of iterations the variation in
 the histogram will become saturated and at such point the algorithm should
 proceed to the next smaller modification factor, f.

conducted an extensive study of the impact of various implementation adjustments
 on the accuracy and precision of the algorithm.
 A central element of their method was to run the algorithm multiple times
 for the 2D Ising model and obtain the histogram of the location of the
 peak of the specific heat capacity.
 The histogram shows a Gaussian distribution, of which the width indicates
 the relative precision of the algorithm under different circumstances,
 and the center relative to the known analytic solution indicates the accuracy.
 (This technique has been heavily borrowed in the present study.) Their specific
 conclusions included a number of optimization suggestions, including that
 the density of states should only be updated with the modification factor,
 f, after a number of spin-flip trials equal to the size of the lattice,
 rather than at every trial.
